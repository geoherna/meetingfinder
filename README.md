1. [Installation / Requirements](#installation)

## Installation
You will need [composer](https://getcomposer.org) in order to install the required packages (PHPUnit, PHPDoc) and their respective dependencies.

Download the project source files into your server document root. For example, in nginx on most linux distros, this would be `/usr/share/nginx/html`
Once files are downloaded you will need to install composer dependencies as mentioned above by running:

    composer install
